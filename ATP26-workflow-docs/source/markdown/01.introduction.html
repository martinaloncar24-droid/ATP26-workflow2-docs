<h1 id="web-development">Web development</h1>
<p>is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World
Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can
range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network
services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development
commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web
server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
development.</p>
<p>Among Web professionals, “Web development” usually refers to the main
non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2]
Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
<h4 id="for-larger-organizations">For larger organizations</h4>
<p>and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of
people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may
only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative
effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run
in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4]
Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has
become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
